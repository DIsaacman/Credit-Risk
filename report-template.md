# Credit Risk Report 
### Module 12 Report Template

## Overview of the Analysis

In this excersize, Python library scikit-learn was used for supervised machine learning to create a model to determine the credit risk of the lending data provided. 

The "target/dependant variable" or "y value" was the `loan_status` indicating if a loan was at risk. While the feature set (Independent Variable) included additional data points collected such as `loan_size`

* The purpose of the analysis is to predict the risk of a loan based on the information gathered about the clients. The model will be used to assess wether a loan applicant is creditworthy, or a credit-risk

The financial information was based on loan_size,interest_rate,borrower_income,debt_to_income,num_of_accounts,derogatory_marks,total_debt to then predict the loan_status.

As with any Maachine Laerning proces, the model needs to be trained, tested and split.

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
